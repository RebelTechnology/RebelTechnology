project: Memory, CV and trigger recorder
clock or ramp time base, in and out.
DAC1 out normalled to time in.
DAC2 to CV out
CV in and knob summed to ADC.
Trigger in and pushbutton on EXTI input.
Time in both EXTI and ADC function.
Time out multi from Time in.

CV in/out range +-5v
Time in/out range 0-10v

Store sequence in flash when toggled to Stop mode.

Mnemonic from Ancient Greek μνημονικός (mnēmonikós, “of memory”), from μνήμων (mnḗmōn, “remembering, mindful”) Μνήμων
Anything (especially something in verbal form) used to help remember something.

Memory is a new project for a CV and trigger recorder. It is very similar in implementation to TapTempo / Chronos.

The user should be able to record knob movements and button presses, or incoming CV and triggers.
A toggle switches between record, overdub (record and playback) and playback modes.
Another toggle switches between two playback synchronisation methods (clock and ramp) and stop.

The inputs and outputs are: sync, trigger and cv (total six jacks).

The controls are: CV, trigger, quantize, 2x mode toggles.

Quantize operates on the output timing of the trigger and CV, and functions a bit like sample and hold, with adjustable granularity. At fully clockwise the playback will happen at max speed (ie sampling rate). Turning it the quantize locks the outputs first at 128ths of the recorded period, then 64ths, 32ths, 16ths, 12ths, 8ths, et c.
