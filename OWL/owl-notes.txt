Theremin Bollards / rack OWL

David wants 5 OWLs in one rack.
Will 4 be enough?

1 set of 4 rotary encoders, push-buttons to select which unit, LCD screen show current settings
rotary push-encoder to select/edit patch
(similar to lexicon MX300 stereo or MX400 dual-stereo)

1 ui processor: lcd, encoders, routing
(spark photon?)
run extra patch in ui processor?

Flexible routing:
Dual SP4T Analog Switch
TS3A5017 is a dual single-pole quadruple-throw (4:1) analog switch that is
designed to operate from 2.3 V to 3.6 V.

NLAS3699 Dual DPDT Ultra-Low RON Switch
Single Supply Operation 1.65 to 3.6 V VCC

TS3A26746E 2 X 2 Crosspoint Switch for Audio Applications

Dual 4ch muxes
The CD4052B is a differential 4-Channel multiplexer having
two binary control inputs, A and B, and an inhibit input. The
two binary input signals select 1 of 4 pairs of channels to be
turned on and connect the analog inputs to the outputs.

HEF4052BT

The DG408 Single 8-Channel, and DG409 Differential
4-Channel monolithic CMOS analog multiplexers are drop-in
replacements for the popular DG508A and DG509A series
devices. They each include an array of eight analog
switches, a TTL/CMOS compatible digital decode circuit for
channel selection, a voltage reference for logic thresholds
and an ENABLE input for device selection when several
multiplexers are present. Audio Switching Systems.

The TS3A5017 is a dual single-pole quadruple-throw
analog switch that is designed to operate from
2.3 V to 3.6 V. This device can handle both digital
and analog signals, and signals up to V+ can be
transmitted in either direction.

The TS5A3357 is a high-performance, single-pole, triple-throw (SP3T) analog
switch designed to operate from 1.65 V to 5.5 V. It offers low ON-state resistance
and low I/O capacitance for very low signal distortion. The break-before-make
feature allows transfer of a signal from one port to another with minimal signal
distortion. This device also offers a low charge injection, which makes it suitable
for high-performance audio and data acquisition systems.
