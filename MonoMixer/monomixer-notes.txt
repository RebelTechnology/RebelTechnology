Unity gain at 3 o'clock

Attenuated bus outputs are unity gain at fully clockwise

---------------------------------------------------------

Gain

in 3v, 9 o'clock gain, out 0.54v (gain 0.18x)
in 3v, 12 o'clock gain, out 1.31v (gain 0.44x)
in 3v, 3 o'clock gain, out 3.00v (gain 1.00x)
in 3v, full gain, out 5.8v (gain 1.93x)

3 o'clock: 1x

input signal < -11.6v causes fold-back spike in output.

output +/-10v (max 20.6Vpp)

---------------------------------------------------------

Power

+/-12v 10-12mA depending on level of input signal (max 13.8mA measured)
