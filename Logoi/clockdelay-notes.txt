the way we test the CV inputs on Logoi is as follows:
1) connect a clock to the bottom left input, and turn all knobs fully counter clockwise.
2) connect a CV signal (another clock will do) to the divider CV input (top left)
3) turn up the left CV attenuator (lower left knob) - you should now see the divider output LED (left) change
4) repeat for right side (easiest with toggle in the down position)
